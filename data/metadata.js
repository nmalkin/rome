    "Arch of Septimius Severus": {
        image: "septimius.jpg",
        description: "Situated on the triumphal route that led to the Capitoline Hill, the Arch of Severus was erected by the Senate in AD 203 on the tenth anniversary (decennalia) of the emperor's accession and in commemoration of his defeat of the Parthians and the capture of Ctesiphon in AD 198. Originally, the arch was surmounted with a statue of Severus and his sons riding in a chariot drawn by six horses. In AD 212, after Caracalla became emperor, he murdered his brother Geta and removed his name from the dedicatory inscription.<br><br> The Arch of Severus was the first major architectural addition to the Forum in eighty years. Placed diagonally opposite the Arch of Augustus, which also had been erected to celebrate a triumph over the Parthians, it symbolically linked Severus, who had come to power after a bloody civil war, with Rome's first emperor. So debilitating was this struggle, as Roman legion fought Roman legion, that Gibbon considered Severus to be the principal author of the decline of the Roman empire.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/archseverus.html'>Source</a>"

        description: "The Rostra was the platform from which orators spoke to the assembled people, its name taken from the bronze ships' beaks that decorated the front (the first were from the victory at Antium in 338 BC), their supporting vertical slots and large dowel holes still to be seen. Planned by Caesar but given its final form by Augustus in 42 BC, what now is visible of the Rostra is an early twentieth-century restoration. It was here that Antony delivered his funeral speech for Caesar, and here that the Triumvirs proscribed Cicero and other political foes.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/rostra.html'>Source</a>"

        description: "Traditionally vowed in 367 BC to commemorate the reconciliation between patricians and plebians, the Temple of Concord was rebuilt in 121 BC to foster harmony after the murder of Gracchus. It was restored during the reign of Augustus by Tiberius, who probably rededicated the Temple in AD 12. The restoration was distinguished by its opulent marble and rich architectural ornamentation. In the cella, which is the central chamber or sanctuary of a temple, a row of Corinthian columns, the capitals of which had pairs of leaping rams in place of the corner volutes, was raised on a continuous plinth projecting from the wall, which divided the cella into bays, each containing a niche. Such was the wealth of fine Greek sculpture, paintings, and other works of art that the Temple seems to have been a museum. It also was used for meetings of the Senate, especially in times of civil disturbance.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/concord.html'>Source</a>"

Three fluted columns from the southeast corner of the pronaos still carry part of the entablature, the frieze of which was elaborately decorated with implements of sacrifice and bucrania (ox skulls), which were believed to ward off evil.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/vespasian.html'>Source</a>"

        description: "Dedicated in 498 BC, the Temple of Saturn is the oldest sacred place in Rome, after the Temples of Vesta and Jupiter. It was rebuilt in 42 BC and again, in the fourth century AD, by the senate and people of Rome, as recorded on the architrave. The surviving Ionic columns, with their scrolled volutes, date from this period. Because of the link of Saturn with agriculture, the original source of Rome's wealth, the temple was the repository for the State treasury, the Aerarium Populi Roman (from aes, bronze), which was located beneath the stairs under the high podium. It also contained the bronze tablets on which Roman law was inscribed. In the cella was an ivory statue, its feet fettered with woolen bonds, which were loosened on the Saturnalia (December 17).<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/saturn.html'>Source</a>",

It again was rebuilt by Diocletian after the fire of AD 283 and later restored by Gabinus Vettius Probianus, urban prefect in AD 416, who embellished the interior with statues by Polyclitus, Praxiteles, and Timarchus (his son).  <br><br> The Basilica housed the civil law courts and tabernae provided space for government offices and banking. In the first century AD, it also was used for sessions of the Centumviri (Court of the Hundred), who presided over matters of inheritance.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/julia.html'>Source</a>",

        description: "Vowed in hope of victory at the legendary Battle of Lake Regillus, where the Dioscuri appeared after the battle. Dedicated in 484 BC, restored in 117 BC, rebuilt by Tiberius (who rededicated it in AD 6) with the spoils of the German campaign (Suetonius, XX), and incorporated by Caligula as the vestibule of his palace and the Dioscuri its gate-keepers (Suetonius, Life, XXII.2; Dio LIX.28.5), the Temple of Castor and Pollux frequently served as a meeting place for the Senate and was where the standards of weights and measures were kept. There was a high podium, with stairs leading down to a rostra and, in the intercolumniations at the base, a series of chambers (loculi). Originally, the front of the podium was designed to provide a tribunal or platform for speaking; but, by the early third century, the lateral stairs had been replaced by a single flight in front. Clodius completely demolished the steps, effectively transforming it into a fortress.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/castor.html'>Source</a>",

In the front was a recessed semicircular niche and an altar that marked the site of the funeral pyre where Caesar's body had been cremated after his death on the Ides of March.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/julius.html'>Source</a>",

        description: "The wedge-shaped area between the Temple of Vesta and the Temple of Antonius Pius and Faustina marks the site of the Regia, thought by the Romans to have been the residence of their early kings, beginning with the second, Numa Pompilius (Plutarch, Life, XIV.1), who donated it to the Pontifex Maximus, the chief priest and the administrative and spiritual superior of the Vestal Virgins. The Regia was considered a sacred space and, although the seat of authority, was not where the pontiff lived. That house was the domus publica, which originally was part of the House of the Vestals until Augustus assumed the office in 12 BC and moved the official residence to the Palatine. Caesar lived in the domus publica for almost twenty years, when he assumed the office of Pontifex Maximus in 62 BC (which allowed him to move from his unfashionable quarters in the Subura). That year, the festival of the Bona Dea was celebrated and it was where Publius Clodius Pulcher, disguised as a woman, was caught trying to seduce Caesar's wife. The Regia also was where records and documents were kept, the annals and calendar, and where the college of pontiffs assembled.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/regia.html'>Source</a>",

        description: "Containing the sacred fire and the Palladium, an effigy of Athene (Minerva) believed to have been brought by Aeneas from Troy, this ancient temple was built in imitation of a primitive round hut, its hearth fire symbolizing the perpetuity of the Roman State. It was not a true temple in that its space was not inaugurated, nor did it contain an image of Vesta, the goddess of the household hearth. As the handmaidens of Vesta, the principal duty of the six Vestals was never to allow the flame to be extinguished, an arduous task in a building with a vent in the roof. There also was danger that the temple, itself, might catch fire, which it sometimes did. It was destroyed in the fire of Nero in AD 64, which reached this point of the Forum. The last time it burned, in AD 191, the temple was restored by Julia Domna, the wife of Severus. Once a year, on June 15, the ashes of the tended fire were ritually thrown into the Tiber.<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/vesta.html'>Source</a>",

It was a place for business and, in the porticus of Gaius and Lucius (the grandsons of Augustus) fronting the Forum, there were the Tabernae Novae (New Shops).

After the fire of AD 283, the Curia was reconstructed by Diocletian. The present building was converted to a church in AD 630, which accounts for the state of preservation. In the mid seventeenth century, the bronze doors were removed to serve as the portals of the basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano (St. John Lateran). In 1937-1938, to celebrate the two thousandth anniversary of the birth of Augustus, Rome's first emperor, Mussolini restored the Curia as part of larger urban work projects<br><a class='reference' target='_blank' href='http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/curiajulia.html'>Source</a>",
